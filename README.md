# Gaussian Kernel Project
Generator and DataStorage Object for 2 and 3 Dimentional Gaussian Kernals for C# and Laplacian of Gaussian Kernels. 

## Instuctions
GaussianKernal.cs has 4 classes. 1 of them is abstract class(GaussianKernel) that allows access to the raw data and parents 2(GaussianKernel2D, GaussianKernel3D) of the other that allows for simple access to the data stuctures.

The final class is the static Gaussian Kernel Generator class acts as a builder for all a 3D and a 2D kernels.
